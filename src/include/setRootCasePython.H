    DAFoam  : Discrete Adjoint with OpenFOAM
    Version : v3


    Description:
        This is similar to setRootCase.H except we set the last argument
        initialise=false because we don't want to print the long OpenFOAM header
        We also add a -python bool option to tell UPstream.C not to call
        MPI_Finalize because we want mpi4py to call it instead
