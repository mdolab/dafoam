    long_description="""
      DAFoam contains a suite of adjoint solvers to efficiently compute derivatives. It also provides a Python interface to interact with a high-fidelity gradient-based design optimization framework (MACH). DAFoam is based on OpenFOAM and has the following features:

      - It implements an efficient discrete adjoint approach with competitive speed, scalability, accuracy, and compatibility.
      - It allows rapid discrete adjoint development for any steady and unsteady OpenFOAM primal solvers with modifying only a few hundred lines of source codes.
      - It supports design optimizations for a wide range of disciplines such as aerodynamics, heat transfer, structures, hydrodynamics, and radiation.
